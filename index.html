                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>I am a prospective graduate student pursuing a PhD in the Computer Science field. Interests include robotics and digital security. I have been a teaching assistant since August 2022 for the introductory C/C++ course at Washington State University. Career goal is to become a career-track professor.</p>
                <p>I have knowledge of C++, C, C#, Swift, Python, ARM9 assembly, Verilog, and exposure to many other languages. I created a video for students learning how to use git in 300-level courses. The video covers simple setup, explains when to commit, and proper usage of branches.</p>

                <h2>Capstone Project (Completed May 2024)</h2>
                <p>In May 2024, I finished my academic capstone project. Our group worked with an organization called Council on Aging in Colfax, WA. We developed an app to assist non vocal child patients express essential needs and desires. The app runs on Android devices, built using Flutter and Dart. The user interface consists of squares - each containing an icon and associated color. I worked on the backend and did not work extensively with the user interface. I focused on tile creation, database implementation, and database configuration. A factory pattern was used for tile creation.</p>
                <p>Our group concluded this year's project and started on a project for next year's students. I wrote documentation in a Markdown document, specified the format for JSON data, described use of the JSON data, contained a summary of our team's meeting with the client, and some wireframes (produced by team members). This new application will be used to retrieve patient/caretaker feedback for Boost Collaborative - a non-profit organization in Colfax, WA.</p>
